# Random-Password-Generator
A repository for a simple web app that allows users to generate a safe random password for their various accounts that they may have.

## Proposal
My workplace deals with a large amount of confidential data that must be accessed using secure usernames and passwords on various platforms. Cybersecurity has recently been highlighted as a key aim for the organisation and part of this includes using more secure passwords to avoid leaks of confidential information that can lead to reputational damage. It can be hard to come up with a random collection of numbers or letters for a password which would generally be very secure option so instead you have people using easily guessable passwords for ease such as their name or birthday month. In order to reduce the burden of coming up with new passwords and wondering if they are secure enough, it would be so much easier if they were able to create a random password at the click of a button. This is where this very application comes into play. The aim of this app is to reduce colleagues' workloads and increase cybersecurity by creating a random collection of letters, numbers and special characters instantly.
